## Introduction

This GitHub repository contains a refactored version of the Horiseon marketing website. The main purpose of this refactoring effort is to improve the website's codebase by incorporating semantic HTML elements, consolidating CSS styles, and enhancing accessibility through the use of alt text.

The deployed website can be found here: [Horiseon Marketing Website](https://kane-chang.github.io/marketing-website-refactor/).

## Features

- Utilizes semantic HTML elements for better code structure and search engine optimization (SEO).
- Consolidates CSS code for improved maintainability and reduced redundancy.
- Provides alt text for images to enhance website accessibility.
- Organized and well-commented codebase for easier understanding and future development.

## Semantic HTML Elements
I have replaced non-semantic HTML elements with appropriate semantic elements to enhance the website's structure and SEO. This improves the overall readability of the code and helps search engines better understand the content, and aid screen-readers.

## Consolidated CSS
The CSS styles have been consolidated and organized to eliminate redundancy and improve code maintainability. This ensures a more efficient and manageable stylesheet.

## Accessibility Improvements
I have added descriptive alt text to all images and icons used on the website. This makes the site more accessible to users with disabilities and improves overall usability.
